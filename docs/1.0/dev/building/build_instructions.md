## Prerequisites

DuckDB needs CMake and a C++11-compliant compiler (e.g., GCC, Apple-Clang, MSVC).
Additionally, we recommend using the [Ninja build system](https://ninja-build.org/), which automatically parallelizes the build process.

Clone the DuckDB repository.

```batch
git clone https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb
```

We recommend creating a full clone of the repository. Note that the directory uses approximately 1.2 GB of disk space.

### Linux Packages

Install the required packages with the package manager of your distribution.

Ubuntu and Debian:

```batch
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git g++ cmake ninja-build libssl-dev
```

Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat:

```batch
sudo yum install -y git g++ cmake ninja-build openssl-devel
```

Alpine Linux:

```batch
apk add g++ git make cmake ninja
```

### macOS

Install Xcode and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then, install the required packages with:

```batch
brew install cmake ninja
```

### Windows

Consult the [Windows CI workflow](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/v0.10.2/.github/workflows/Windows.yml#L234) for a list of packages used to build DuckDB on Windows.

On Windows, the DuckDB Python package requires the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) to be built and [to run]({% link docs/1.0/api/python/known_issues.md %}#error-when-importing-the-duckdb-python-package-on-windows).

## Building DuckDB

To build DuckDB we use a Makefile which in turn calls into CMake. We also advise using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html) as the generator for CMake.

```batch
GEN=ninja make
```

> Bestpractice It is not advised to directly call CMake, as the Makefile sets certain variables that are crucial to properly building the package.

For testing, it can be useful to build DuckDB with statically linked core extensions. To do so, run:

```batch
CORE_EXTENSIONS='autocomplete;icu;parquet;json' GEN=ninja make
```

This option also accepts out-of-tree extensions:

```batch
CORE_EXTENSIONS='autocomplete;icu;parquet;json;delta' GEN=ninja make
```

For more details, see the [“Building Extensions” page]({% link docs/1.0/dev/building/building_extensions.md %}).

## Troubleshooting

### The Build Runs Out of Memory

Ninja parallelizes the build, which can cause out-of-memory issues on systems with limited resources. They also occur on Alpine Linux. In these cases, avoid using Ninja:

```batch
make
```
