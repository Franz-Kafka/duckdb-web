## Prerequisites

The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) can be used via the [`httpfs` extension]({% link docs/1.3/core_extensions/httpfs/overview.md %}).
This can be installed with the `INSTALL httpfs` SQL command. This only needs to be run once.

## Credentials and Configuration

You need to create [HMAC keys](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings;tab=interoperability) and declare them:

```sql
CREATE SECRET (
    TYPE gcs,
    KEY_ID '⟨AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE⟩',
    SECRET '⟨wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY⟩'
);
```

## Querying

After setting up the GCS credentials, you can query the GCS data using:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM read_parquet('gs://⟨gcs_bucket⟩/⟨file.parquet⟩');
```

## Attaching to a Database

You can [attach to a database file]({% link docs/1.3/guides/network_cloud_storage/duckdb_over_https_or_s3.md %}) in read-only mode:

```sql
LOAD httpfs;
ATTACH 'gs://⟨gcs_bucket⟩/⟨file.duckdb⟩' AS ⟨duckdb_database⟩ (READ_ONLY);
```

> Databases in Google Cloud Storage can only be attached in read-only mode.
