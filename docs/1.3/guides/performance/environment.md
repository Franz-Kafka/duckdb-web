The environment where DuckDB is run has an obvious impact on performance. This page focuses on the effects of the hardware configuration and the operating system used.

## Hardware Configuration

### CPU

DuckDB works efficiently on both AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 (AArch64) CPU architectures.

### Memory

> Bestpractice Aim for 1-4 GB memory per thread.

#### Minimum Required Memory

As a rule of thumb, DuckDB requires a _minimum_ of 125 MB of memory per thread.
For example, if you use 8 threads, you need at least 1 GB of memory.
If you are working in a memory-constrained environment, consider [limiting the number of threads]({% link docs/1.3/configuration/pragmas.md %}#threads), e.g., by issuing:

```sql
SET threads = 4;
```

#### Memory for Ideal Performance

The amount of memory required for ideal performance depends on several factors, including the data set size and the queries to execute.
Maybe surprisingly, the _queries_ have a larger effect on the memory requirement.
Workloads containing large joins over many-to-many tables yield large intermediate datasets and thus require more memory for their evaluation to fully fit into the memory.
As an approximation, aggregation-heavy workloads require 1-2 GB memory per thread and join-heavy workloads require 3-4 GB memory per thread.

#### Larger-than-Memory Workloads

DuckDB can process larger-than-memory workloads by spilling to disk.
This is possible thanks to _out-of-core_ support for grouping, joining, sorting and windowing operators.
Note that larger-than-memory workloads can be processed both in persistent mode and in in-memory mode as DuckDB still spills to disk in both modes.

### Local Disk

**Disk type.**
DuckDB's disk-based mode is designed to work best with SSD and NVMe disks. While HDDs are supported, they will result in low performance, especially for write operations.

**Disk-based vs. in-memory storage.**
Counter-intuitively, using a disk-based DuckDB instance can be faster than an in-memory instance due to compression.
Read more in the [“How to Tune Workloads” page]({% link docs/1.3/guides/performance/how_to_tune_workloads.md %}#persistent-vs-in-memory-tables).

**File systems.**
On Linux, [DuckDB performs best with the XFS file system](https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-615-filesystems/5) but it also performs reasonably well with other file systems such as ext4.
On Windows, we recommend using NTFS and avoiding FAT32.

> Note that DuckDB databases have built-in checksums, so integrity checks from the file system are not required to prevent data corruption.

### Network-Attached Disks

**Cloud disks.** DuckDB runs well on network-backed cloud disks such as [AWS EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) for both read-only and read-write workloads.

**Network-attached storage.**
Network-attached storage can serve DuckDB for read-only workloads.
However, _it is not recommended to run DuckDB in read-write mode on network-attached storage (NAS)._
These setups include [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System),
network drives such as [SMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) and
[Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)).
Based on user reports, running read-write workloads on network-attached storage can result in slow and unpredictable performance,
as well as spurious errors cased by the underlying file system.

> Warning Avoid running DuckDB in read-write mode on network-attached storage.

> Bestpractice Fast disks are important if your workload is larger than memory and/or fast data loading is important. Only use network-backed disks if they are reliable (e.g., cloud disks) and guarantee high IO.

## Operating System

We recommend using the latest stable version of operating systems: macOS, Windows, and Linux are all well-tested and DuckDB can run on them with high performance.

### Linux

DuckDB runs on all mainstream Linux distributions released in the last ≈5 years.
If you don't have a particular preference, we recommended using Ubuntu Linux LTS due to its stability and the fact that most of DuckDB’s Linux test suite jobs run on Ubuntu workers.

#### glibc vs. musl libc

DuckDB can be built with both [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) (default) and [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/) (see the [build guide]({% link docs/1.3/dev/building/linux.md %})).
However, note that DuckDB binaries built with musl libc have lower performance.
In practice, this can lead to a slowdown of more than 5× on compute-intensive workloads.
Therefore, it's recommended to use a Linux distribution with glibc for performance-oriented workloads when running DuckDB.

## Memory Allocator

If you have a many-core CPU running on a system where DuckDB ships with [`jemalloc`]({% link docs/1.3/core_extensions/jemalloc.md %}) as the default memory allocator, consider [enabling the allocator's background threads]({% link docs/1.3/core_extensions/jemalloc.md %}#background-threads).
