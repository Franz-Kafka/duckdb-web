<div id="rrdiagram"></div>

The `CASE` expression performs a switch based on a condition. The basic form is identical to the ternary condition used in many programming languages (`CASE WHEN cond THEN a ELSE b END` is equivalent to `cond ? a : b`). With a single condition this can be expressed with `IF(cond, a, b)`.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE integers AS SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]) AS i;
SELECT i, CASE WHEN i > 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS test
FROM integers;
```

| i | test |
|--:|-----:|
| 1 | 0    |
| 2 | 0    |
| 3 | 1    |

This is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT i, IF(i > 2, 1, 0) AS test
FROM integers;
```

The `WHEN cond THEN expr` part of the `CASE` expression can be chained, whenever any of the conditions returns true for a single tuple, the corresponding expression is evaluated and returned.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE integers AS SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]) AS i;
SELECT i, CASE WHEN i = 1 THEN 10 WHEN i = 2 THEN 20 ELSE 0 END AS test
FROM integers;
```

| i | test |
|--:|-----:|
| 1 | 10   |
| 2 | 20   |
| 3 | 0    |

The `ELSE` clause of the `CASE` expression is optional. If no `ELSE` clause is provided and none of the conditions match, the `CASE` expression will return `NULL`.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE integers AS SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]) AS i;
SELECT i, CASE WHEN i = 1 THEN 10 END AS test
FROM integers;
```

| i | test |
|--:|-----:|
| 1 | 10   |
| 2 | NULL |
| 3 | NULL |

It is also possible to provide an individual expression after the `CASE` but before the `WHEN`. When this is done, the `CASE` expression is effectively transformed into a switch statement.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE integers AS SELECT unnest([1, 2, 3]) AS i;
SELECT i, CASE i WHEN 1 THEN 10 WHEN 2 THEN 20 WHEN 3 THEN 30 END AS test
FROM integers;
```

| i | test |
|--:|-----:|
| 1 | 10   |
| 2 | 20   |
| 3 | 30   |

This is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT i, CASE WHEN i = 1 THEN 10 WHEN i = 2 THEN 20 WHEN i = 3 THEN 30 END AS test
FROM integers;
```
