title: Building DuckDB from Source

## When Should You Build DuckDB?

DuckDB binaries are available for _stable_ and _preview_ builds on the [installation page]({% link install/index.html %}).
In most cases, it's recommended to use these binaries.
When you are running on an experimental platform (e.g., [Raspberry Pi]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/raspberry_pi.md %})) or you would like to build the project for an unmerged pull request,
you can build DuckDB from source based on the [`duckdb/duckdb` repository hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/).
This page explains the steps for building DuckDB.

## Prerequisites

DuckDB needs CMake and a C++11-compliant compiler (e.g., GCC, Apple-Clang, MSVC).
Additionally, we recommend using the [Ninja build system](https://ninja-build.org/), which automatically parallelizes the build process.

## Platforms

### Supported Platforms

DuckDB fully supports Linux, macOS and Windows. Both AMD64 (x86_64) and ARM64 (AArch64) builds are available for these platforms.

| Platform name      | Description                                                            |

For instructions to build from source, see:

* [Linux]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/linux.md %})
* [macOS]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/macos.md %})
* [Windows]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/windows.md %})

### Experimental Platforms

There are several additional platforms with varying levels of support.
For some platforms, DuckDB binaries and extensions (or a [subset of extensions]({% link docs/1.2/extensions/extension_distribution.md %}#platforms)) are distributed. For others, building from source is possible.

| Platform name          | Description                                                                                          |

> These platforms are not covered by DuckDB's community support. For details on commercial support, see the [support policy page](https://duckdblabs.com/community_support_policy#platforms).

Below, we provide detailed build instructions for some platforms:

* [Android]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/android.md %})
* [Raspberry Pi]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/raspberry_pi.md %})

### Outdated Platforms

DuckDB can be built for end-of-life platforms such as [macOS 11](https://endoflife.date/macos) and [CentOS 7/8](https://endoflife.date/centos) using the instructions provided for macOS and Linux.

### Unofficial and Unsupported Platforms

Several platforms are not supported or supported on a best-effort basis.
See the [“Unofficial and Unsupported Platforms” page]({% link docs/1.2/dev/building/unofficial_and_unsupported_platforms.md %}) for details.

## Limitations

Currently, DuckDB has the following limitations:

* The DuckDB codebase is not compatible with [C++23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B23). Therefore, trying to compile DuckDB with `-std=c++23` will fail.
* The `-march=native` build flag, i.e., compiling DuckDB with the local machine's native instructions set, is not supported.

## Troubleshooting Guides

We provide troubleshooting guides for building DuckDB:
