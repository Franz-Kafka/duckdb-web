title: CREATE MACRO Statement
---

The `CREATE MACRO` statement can create a scalar or table macro (function) in the catalog.

For a scalar macro, `CREATE MACRO` is followed by the name of the macro, and optionally parameters within a set of parentheses. The keyword `AS` is next, followed by the text of the macro. By design, a scalar macro may only return a single value.
For a table macro, the syntax is similar to a scalar macro except `AS` is replaced with `AS TABLE`. A table macro may return a table of arbitrary size and shape.

> If a `MACRO` is temporary, it is only usable within the same database connection and is deleted when the connection is closed.

## Examples

### Scalar Macros

Create a macro that adds two expressions (`a` and `b`):

```sql
CREATE MACRO add(a, b) AS a + b;
```

Create a macro, replacing possible existing definitions:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO add(a, b) AS a + b;
```

Create a macro if it does not already exist, else do nothing:

```sql
CREATE MACRO IF NOT EXISTS add(a, b) AS a + b;
```

Create a macro for a `CASE` expression:

```sql
CREATE MACRO ifelse(a, b, c) AS CASE WHEN a THEN b ELSE c END;
```

Create a macro that does a subquery:

```sql
CREATE MACRO one() AS (SELECT 1);
```

Macros are schema-dependent, and have an alias, `FUNCTION`:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION main.my_avg(x) AS sum(x) / count(x);
```

Create a macro with a default parameter:

```sql
CREATE MACRO add_default(a, b := 5) AS a + b;
```

Create a macro `arr_append` (with a functionality equivalent to `array_append`):

```sql
CREATE MACRO arr_append(l, e) AS list_concat(l, list_value(e));
```

Create a macro with a typed parameter:

```sql
CREATE MACRO is_maximal(a INTEGER) AS a = 2^31 - 1;
```

### Table Macros

Create a table macro without parameters:

```sql
CREATE MACRO static_table() AS TABLE
    SELECT 'Hello' AS column1, 'World' AS column2;
```

Create a table macro with parameters (that can be of any type):

```sql
CREATE MACRO dynamic_table(col1_value, col2_value) AS TABLE
    SELECT col1_value AS column1, col2_value AS column2;
```

Create a table macro that returns multiple rows. It will be replaced if it already exists, and it is temporary (will be automatically deleted when the connection ends):

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP MACRO dynamic_table(col1_value, col2_value) AS TABLE
    SELECT col1_value AS column1, col2_value AS column2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Hello' AS col1_value, 456 AS col2_value;
```

Pass an argument as a list:

```sql
CREATE MACRO get_users(i) AS TABLE
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE uid IN (SELECT unnest(i));
```

An example for how to use the `get_users` table macro is the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users AS
    SELECT *
    FROM (VALUES (1, 'Ada'), (2, 'Bob'), (3, 'Carl'), (4, 'Dan'), (5, 'Eve')) t(uid, name);
SELECT * FROM get_users([1, 5]);
```

To define macros on arbitrary tables, use the [`query_table` function]({% link docs/preview/guides/sql_features/query_and_query_table_functions.md %}). For example, the following macro computes a column-wise checksum on a table:

```sql
CREATE MACRO checksum(tbl) AS TABLE
    SELECT bit_xor(md5_number(COLUMNS(*)::VARCHAR))
    FROM query_table(tbl);

CREATE TABLE tbl AS SELECT unnest([42, 43]) AS x, 100 AS y;
SELECT * FROM checksum('tbl');
```

## Overloading

It is possible to overload a macro based on the types or the number of its parameters; this works for both scalar and table macros.

By providing overloads we can have both `add_x(a, b)` and `add_x(a, b, c)` with different function bodies.

```sql
CREATE MACRO add_x
    (a, b) AS a + b,
    (a, b, c) AS a + b + c;
```

```sql
SELECT
    add_x(21, 42) AS two_args,
    add_x(21, 42, 21) AS three_args;
```

| two_args | three_args |
|----------|------------|
|    63    |     84     |


```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO is_maximal
    (a TINYINT) AS a = 2^7 - 1,
    (a INT) AS a = 2^31 - 1;
```

```sql
SELECT
    is_maximal(127::TINYINT) AS tiny,
    is_maximal(127) AS regular;
```

|   tiny   |  regular   |
|----------|------------|
|   true   |    false   |


## Syntax

<div id="rrdiagram"></div>

Macros allow you to create shortcuts for combinations of expressions.

```sql
CREATE MACRO add(a) AS a + b;
```

```console
Binder Error:
Referenced column "b" not found in FROM clause!
```

This works:

```sql
CREATE MACRO add(a, b) AS a + b;
```

Usage example:

```sql
SELECT add(1, 2) AS x;
```

| x |
|--:|
| 3 |

However, this fails:

```sql
SELECT add('hello', 3);
```

```console
Binder Error:
Could not choose a best candidate function for the function call "add(STRING_LITERAL, INTEGER_LITERAL)". In order to select one, please add explicit type casts.
	Candidate functions:
	add(DATE, INTEGER) -> DATE
	add(INTEGER, INTEGER) -> INTEGER
```

Macros can have default parameters.

`b` is a default parameter:

```sql
CREATE MACRO add_default(a, b := 5) AS a + b;
```

The following will result in 42:

```sql
SELECT add_default(37);
```

The order of named parameters does not matter:

```sql
CREATE MACRO triple_add(a, b := 5, c := 10) AS a + b + c;
```

```sql
SELECT triple_add(40, c := 1, b := 1) AS x;
```

| x  |
|---:|
| 42 |

When macros are used, they are expanded (i.e., replaced with the original expression), and the parameters within the expanded expression are replaced with the supplied arguments. Step by step:

The `add` macro we defined above is used in a query:

```sql
SELECT add(40, 2) AS x;
```

Internally, `add` is replaced with its definition of `a + b`:

```sql
SELECT a + b AS x;
```

Then, the parameters are replaced by the supplied arguments:

```sql
SELECT 40 + 2 AS x;
```

## Limitations

### Using Subquery Macros

Table macros as well as scalar macros defined using scalar subqueries cannot be used in the arguments of table functions. DuckDB will return the following error:

```console
Binder Error:
Table function cannot contain subqueries
```

### Overloads

Overloads for macro functions have to be set at creation, it is not possible to define a macro by the same name twice without first removing the first definition.

### Recursive Functions

Defining recursive functions is not supported.
For example, the following macro – supposed to compute the *n*th number of the Fibonacci sequence – fails:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fibo(n) AS (SELECT 1);
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fibo(n) AS (
    CASE
        WHEN n <= 1 THEN 1
        ELSE fibo(n - 1)
    END
);
SELECT fibo(3);
```

```console
Binder Error:
Max expression depth limit of 1000 exceeded. Use "SET max_expression_depth TO x" to increase the maximum expression depth.
```

### Function Chaining on the First Function Does Not Work

Macros do not support the dot operator for function chaining on the first function.
To illustrate this, see an example with the `lower` function, which works:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO low(s) AS lower(s);
SELECT low('AA');
```

However, rewriting `lower(s)` to use function chaining does not work:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO low(s) AS s.lower();
SELECT low('AA');
```

```console
Binder Error:
Referenced column "s" not found in FROM clause!
```
