> To install the new version, please visit the [installation guide]({% link docs/installation/index.html %}). Note that it can take a few hours to days to release some client libraries (e.g., Go, R, Java) and extensions due to the extra changes and review rounds required.

We are proud to release DuckDB 1.4.0. This release of DuckDB is named “Andium” after the Andean teal _(Anas andium),_
which lives in the Andean highlands of Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador.

In this blog post, we cover the most important features of the new release. DuckDB is moving rather quickly, and we could cover only a small fraction of the changes in this release. For the complete release notes, see the [release page on GitHub](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
