## Introduction

Machine learning prototyping often involves juggling datasets, preprocessing steps, and performance constraints, which can make the process both complex and time-consuming. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is one of Python's most popular and powerful libraries for machine learning, offering a large set of utilities for building and evaluating models. In this post, we will explore how DuckDB complements `scikit-learn` in the model development life cycle, by implementing a penguin species prediction model on Penguins observations in the Palmer Archipelago.

> The following implementation is executed in a [marimo Python notebook](https://marimo.io/), which is available on GitHub, in our [examples repository](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-blog-examples/tree/main/scikit_learn_duckdb).

## Data Preparation

We start by loading the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/) and use DuckDB's [`COLUMNS(*)` expression]({% link docs/preview/sql/expressions/star.md %}#columns) to filter out any record which contains `NA` or `NULL`:

```python
duckdb_conn.read_csv(
    "http://blobs.duckdb.org/data/penguins.csv"
).filter(
    "columns(*)::text != 'NA'"
).filter(
    "columns(*) is not null"
).select(
    "*, row_number() over () as observation_id"
).to_table(
    "penguins_data"
)
```

Even if the `NA` values are removed from the dataset, DuckDB has inferred the column type as `VARCHAR` at the moment of `read_csv`. Therefore, we modify the column type to a numeric type, `DECIMAL(5, 2)`, using the [`ALTER TABLE`]({% link docs/stable/sql/statements/alter_table.md %}#set-data-type) statement:

```python
duckdb_conn.sql(
    "alter table penguins_data alter bill_length_mm set data type decimal(5, 2)"
)
```

> Tip One can also [define the schema]({% link docs/stable/data/csv/tips.md %}#override-the-types-of-specific-columns) at import time.

We can now plot the data and check for species specific clusters. For example, using a [scatter plot](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/) we identify clusters at the combination between bill depth and bill length:

<div align="center" style="margin:10px">
    <a href="/images/blog/scikit-learn-duckdb/penguins_species.png">
        <img
          src="{% link images/blog/scikit-learn-duckdb/penguins_species.png %}"
          alt="Penguins observations, bill depth and length"
          width="700"
        />
    </a>
</div>

We also observe that there are a few descriptive columns in the dataset, such as `species` and `island`. In a machine learning workflow, one common preprocessing step is to transform such values into numerical values, assigning them a unique identifier; a process called _label encoding_. While scikit-learn offers a [LabelEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html) utility, this process is very similar to how we work with [reference tables](https://roelantvos.com/blog/designing-reference-tables-for-the-data-warehouse/) in a data warehouse. Therefore, we define a function which will create, for each column (feature), a reference table, leveraging the DuckDB Python [relational API]({% link docs/stable/clients/python/relational_api.md %}):

```python
def process_reference_data(duckdb_conn):
    for feature in ["species", "island"]:
        duckdb_conn.sql(f"drop table if exists {feature}_ref")
        (
            duckdb_conn.table("penguins_data")
            .select(feature)
            .unique(feature)
            .row_number(
                window_spec=f"over (order by {feature})",
                projected_columns=feature
            )
            .select(f"{feature}, #2 - 1 as {feature}_id")
            .to_table(f"{feature}_ref")
        )
        duckdb_conn.table(f"{feature}_ref").show()
```

After the execution of the above function, two tables which will contain the distinct values of the category and a unique identifier are created, e.g., `species_ref`:

```text
┌───────────┬────────────┐
│  species  │ species_id │
│  varchar  │   int64    │
├───────────┼────────────┤
│ Adelie    │          0 │
│ Chinstrap │          1 │
│ Gentoo    │          2 │
└───────────┴────────────┘
```

The last step in our data preparation step is to define a selection query variable, which selects the data from the initial dataset and the reference tables:

```python
selection_query = (
    conn.table("penguins_data")
    .join(conn.table("island_ref"), condition="island")
    .join(conn.table("species_ref"), condition="species")
)
```

> `selection_query` is lazy evaluated, therefore, no data is retrieved at the definition time.

## Model Training

Our scope is to predict a penguin's specie based on its characteristics (features), such as bill length and depth, flipper length, body mass and island. Such a model is called a classification model because it predicts the category to which the input data belongs.`scikit-learn` offers [multiple classification models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html). For our dataset, we have chosen to implement a [random forest classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), based on decision trees:

<div align="center" style="margin:10px">
    <a href="/images/blog/scikit-learn-duckdb/decision_tree.png">
        <img
          src="{% link images/blog/scikit-learn-duckdb/decision_tree.png %}"
          alt="Model decision tree"
          width="700"
        />
    </a>
</div>

We start by splitting the data into train and test data, with the [`train_test_split` utility](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) from `scikit-learn`:

```python
def train_split_data(selection_query):
    X_df = selection_query.select("""
        bill_length_mm,
        bill_depth_mm,
        flipper_length_mm,
        body_mass_g,
        island_id,
        observation_id,
        species_id
    """).order("observation_id").df()
    y_df = [
        x[0] 
        for x in selection_query.order("observation_id").select("species_id").fetchall()
    ]

    num_test = 0.30
    return train_test_split(X_df, y_df, test_size=num_test)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_split_data(selection_query)
```

Splitting the data is a common step in a machine learning workflow and it returns:
- `X_train`, containing the input data based on which we want to assign a species category;
- `y_train`, containing the species for each record in `X_train`;
- `X_test`, containing the input data based on which we will test the model;
- `y_test`, containing the species for each record in `X_test`.

We then define the [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) and fit the `X_train` and `y_train` data to it. We save the model in a [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) file, such that we can use the model without retraining:

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1, max_depth=2, random_state=5)

model.fit(X_train.drop(["observation_id", "species_id"], axis=1).values, y_train)

pickle.dump(model, open("./model/penguin_model.sav", "wb"))
```

We can now check the model accuracy score:

```python
model.score(
    X_test.drop(["observation_id", "species_id"], axis=1).values, y_test
)
```

```text
0.98
```

> We are working with `pickle` due to the small size of our model. Other persistence methods are detailed on [the `scikit-learn` documentation page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html).

## Inference with DuckDB

Inference is the process of using the model to get predictions on (new) data:

```python
model = pickle.load(open("./model/penguin_model.sav", "rb"))

model.predict(...)
```

When working with DuckDB there are three approaches to retrieve the predicted category from the data. We can use Pandas, or a DuckDB Python UDF with or without batching. In the following, we present these approaches.

### With Pandas

The most common method of retrieving predictions is to load the predictions into a new column in a Pandas dataframe:

```python
predicted_df = selection_query.select("""
    bill_length_mm,
    bill_depth_mm,
    flipper_length_mm,
    body_mass_g,
    island_id,
    observation_id,
    species_id
""").df()

predicted_df["predicted_species_id"] = model.predict(
    predicted_df.drop(["observation_id", "species_id"], axis=1).values
)
```

With DuckDB, the dataframe can be [queried with SQL]({% link docs/stable/guides/python/import_pandas.md %}):

```python
(
    duckdb_conn.table("predicted_df")
    .select("observation_id", "species_id", "predicted_species_id")
    .filter("species_id != predicted_species_id")
)
```

resulting in:

```text
┌────────────────┬────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│ observation_id │ species_id │ predicted_species_id │
│     int64      │   int64    │        int64         │
├────────────────┼────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│             13 │          1 │                    2 │
│             15 │          1 │                    2 │
│             39 │          1 │                    2 │
│             44 │          1 │                    2 │
│             68 │          1 │                    2 │
│             70 │          1 │                    2 │
│             76 │          1 │                    2 │
│             90 │          1 │                    2 │
│             94 │          1 │                    2 │
│            104 │          1 │                    2 │
│            106 │          1 │                    2 │
│            110 │          1 │                    2 │
│            124 │          1 │                    2 │
│            126 │          1 │                    2 │
│            243 │          3 │                    2 │
│            296 │          2 │                    1 │
├────────────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────┤
│ 16 rows                                  3 columns │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> Warning If there is a table which has the same name as the dataframe, then `register` can be used to give another table name to the dataframe, e.g., `duckdb_conn.register("table_name", predicted_df)`

### DuckDB Python UDF, Row by Row

DuckDB offers the possibility to register [User Defined Functions (UDFs)]({% link docs/stable/clients/python/function.md %}) from Python functions. Because the UDF is executed row by row, our prediction function will return the predicted species id for each row:
```python
def get_prediction_per_row(
    bill_length_mm: Decimal,
    bill_depth_mm: Decimal,
    flipper_length_mm: int,
    body_mass_g: int,
    island_id: int
) -> int:
    model = pickle.load(open("./model/penguin_model.sav", "rb"))
    return int(
        model.predict(
            [
                [
                    bill_length_mm,
                    bill_depth_mm,
                    flipper_length_mm,
                    body_mass_g,
                    island_id,
                ]
            ]
        )[0]
    )
```

In the above Python function we provide the required features as input for the model and return the predicted value (an `integer`). With this information, we create the DuckDB function:

```python
duckdb_conn.create_function(
    "predict_species_per_row", get_prediction_per_row, return_type=int
)
```

We can now use the UDF in the SQL `SELECT` clause:

```python
selection_query.select("""
    observation_id,
    species_id,
    predict_species_per_row(
        bill_length_mm, 
        bill_depth_mm, 
        flipper_length_mm, 
        body_mass_g, 
        island_id
    ) as predicted_species_id
""").filter("species_id != predicted_species_id")
```

This returns the same results as above.

### DuckDB Python UDF, Batch Style

While the row-by-row prediction can be useful when the scope is to retrieve the prediction for a limited number of rows, it will be less performant when working with more data. Therefore, by aggregating the data into arrays (which preserve order), we can simulate a mass retrieval (or batch style) of the prediction.

We first create a Python function to get the predictions for a JSON object, which contains the columnar representation of the features needed as model input:

```python
def get_prediction_per_batch(input_data: dict[str, list[Decimal | int ]]) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    input_data example:
        {
            "bill_length_mm": [40.5],
            "bill_depth_mm": [41.5],
            "flipper_length_mm: [250],
            "body_mass_g": [3000],
            "island_id": [1]
        }
    """
    model = pickle.load(open("./model/penguin_model.sav", "rb"))

    input_data_parsed = orjson.loads(input_data)

    input_data_converted_to_numpy = np.stack(tuple(input_data_parsed.values()), axis=1)

    return model.predict(input_data_converted_to_numpy)


duckdb_conn.create_function(
    "predict_species_per_batch",
    get_prediction_per_batch,
    return_type=duckdb.typing.DuckDBPyType(list[int]),
)
```

> While DuckDB has `MAP` and `STRUCT` data types, which convert automatically to a dict, they have a slower execution time compared to `json_object` (including the `orjson` deserialization time).

With `json_object` we extract the columnar representation of the features, in the format `'feature_name': array[feature]`:

```python
json_object(
    'bill_length_mm', array_agg(bill_length_mm),
    'bill_depth_mm', array_agg(bill_depth_mm),
    'flipper_length_mm', array_agg(flipper_length_mm),
    'body_mass_g', array_agg(body_mass_g),
    'island_id', array_agg(island_id)
) as input_data,
```

We then pack in a [`STRUCT`]({% link docs/stable/sql/data_types/struct.md %}), the predictions together with other columns we are interested in:

```python
struct_pack(
    observation_id := array_agg(observation_id),
    species_id := array_agg(species_id),
    predicted_species_id := predict_species_per_batch(input_data)
) as output_data
```

Last, we [`unnest`]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/unnest.md %}) the results, in order to flatten the lists into tables:

```python
.select("""
    unnest(output_data.observation_id) as observation_id,
    unnest(output_data.species_id) as species_id,
    unnest(output_data.predicted_species_id) as predicted_species_id
""")
```

The above query is wrapped into a Python function, named `get_selection_query_for_batch`, with which we can chain queries, e.g., for mass retrieval of incorrect predictions:

```python
get_selection_query_for_batch(selection_query).filter("species_id != predicted_species_id")
```

A batch approach can be implemented by using [`LIMIT` and `OFFSET`]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/limit.md %}) to loop through the data:

```python
for i in range(4):
    (
        get_selection_query_for_batch(
            selection_query
            .order("observation_id")
            .limit(100, offset=100*i)
            .select("*")
        )
        .filter("species_id != predicted_species_id")
    ).show()
```

> `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` are executed last, therefore, they should be applied before the prediction selection.


### Performance Considerations

To obtain performance data on a larger scale dataset, we have generated a dummy dataset with approximately 59 million records. On a [sample]({% link docs/stable/sql/samples.md %}) of 10%, on a 16 GB MacBook Pro, the batch processing ranges between 3 and 4 seconds, while the Pandas implementation is executed under 1 second. This is because the Python UDF includes multiple conversion steps which affect performance:

- parsing the input data as JSON;
- converting the JSON to numpy array;
- unnesting the array to rows.

We have still chosen to show-case the Python UDFs, because they are a powerful asset when working within a Python environment and the performance difference is negligible when we speak of small data.

## Conclusion

In this post, we have demonstrated how DuckDB complements `scikit-learn` in the machine learning development life cycle, with a focus on the data preparation and inference phases. The inference results on the dummy data are poor; is this because of the model or the dummy data? We leave this question open to our readers, as a means to explore how DuckDB can be used in the model evaluation and model optimization phases.
