The [`duckdb/duckdb` GitHub repository](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) has just passed 30&nbsp;000 stars!

![Star history]({% link images/blog/star-history-20250606.png %})

We would like to use this event to stop for a moment and revisit recent developments in the DuckDB ecosystem since last December, not even six months ago, when we reached [25&nbsp;000 stars]({% post_url 2024-12-16-github-25k-stars %}).

## Recent Updates

* We released [DuckDB 1.2.0]({% post_url 2025-02-05-announcing-duckdb-120 %}) and [DuckDB 1.3.0]({% post_url 2025-05-21-announcing-duckdb-130 %}), both packing many new features, performance optimizations and bugfixes.
* We published the [DuckLake specification](https://ducklake.select/), an open format for SQL-as-a-lakehouse. For details, read the [announcement blog post]({% post_url 2025-05-27-ducklake %}) and its coverage in the [Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/28/duckdb_flips_lakehouse_model_with/).
* DuckDB now has a [built-in UI]({% post_url 2025-03-12-duckdb-ui %}).
* DuckDB now supports Iceberg REST Catalog, which also allows it to connect to [Amazon S3 Tables]({% post_url 2025-03-14-preview-amazon-s3-tables %})
* We published the much-requested [roadmap]({% link roadmap.md %}).
* Coincidentally, this is the 100th post on our blog.

## Metrics

Besides the GitHub stars we have also observed a lot of growth in other metrics:

* Each month, our website now welcomes over 3 million unique visitors – more than double than in December. We also see over 700 TB in traffic from millions of extension downloads. Thanks again to Cloudflare for [sponsoring the project]({% link foundation/index.html %}#technical-sponsors).
* Just in this calendar year, we rose 10 positions in the [DB Engines ranking](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) from position 55 to 45.
* We now count [20M+ monthly downloads in PyPI](https://pypistats.org/packages/duckdb).

We would like to reiterate that while we’re happy to see these numbers grow, we are not glorifying them and they are not a target per se in accordance with [Goodhart’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).

## Events

We hosted the first livestreamed [DuckCon in Amsterdam]({% link _events/2025-01-31-duckcon6.md %}) and organized another [DuckDB Meetup]({% link _events/2025-02-20-duckdb-amsterdam-meetup-2.md %}).

## Closing Thoughts

That's it for today.
We would like to thank our community of users and contributors!
We are looking forward to keep growing our community and hope the GitHub stars follow.
We'll report back when we reach 40,000 stars.
