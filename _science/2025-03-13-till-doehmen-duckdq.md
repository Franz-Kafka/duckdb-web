## Description

In this episode we kick off our DuckDB in Research series with Till Döhmen, a software engineer at MotherDuck, where he leads AI efforts. Till shares insights into DuckDQ, a Python library designed for efficient data quality validation in machine learning pipelines, leveraging DuckDB’s high-performance querying capabilities.

We discuss the challenges of ensuring data integrity in ML workflows, the inefficiencies of existing solutions, and how DuckDQ provides a lightweight, drop-in replacement that seamlessly integrates with scikit-learn. Till also reflects on his research journey, the impact of DuckDB’s optimizations, and the future potential of data quality tooling. Plus, we explore how AI tools like ChatGPT are reshaping research and productivity. Tune in for a deep dive into the intersection of databases, machine learning, and data validation!
