## Description

In this episode, we sit down with Daniël ten Wolde, a PhD researcher at CWI’s Database Architectures Group, to explore DuckPGQ—an extension to DuckDB that brings powerful graph querying capabilities to relational databases. Daniel shares his journey into database research, the motivations behind DuckPGQ, and how it simplifies working with graph data. We also dive into the technical challenges of implementing SQL Property Graph Queries (SQL PGQ) in DuckDB, discuss performance benchmarks, and explore the future of DuckPGQ in graph analytics and machine learning. Tune in to learn how this cutting-edge extension is bridging the gap between research and industry!
