## Abstract

SQL's user-defined functions (UDFs) allow developers to express complex
computation using procedural logic. But UDFs have been the bane of database
management systems (DBMSs) for decades because they inhibit optimization
opportunities, potentially slowing down queries significantly. In
response, batching and inlining techniques have been proposed to enable
effective query optimization of UDF calls within SQL. Inlining is now
available in a major commercial DBMS. But the trade-offs between both
approaches on modern DBMSs remain unclear. We evaluate and compare UDF
batching and inlining on enterprise and open-source DBMSs using a
state-of-the-art UDF-centric workload. We observe the surprising result
that although inlining is better on simple UDFs, batching outperforms
inlining by up to 93.4× for more complex UDFs because it makes it easier
for a DBMS’s query optimizer to decorrelate subqueries. We propose a
hybrid approach that chooses batching or inlining to achieve the
best performance.
